## Description

The focus of this project is using object-relational mapping to store, retrieve and manipulate data

## Usage

Users begin in the command line by creating the ecommerce database in mysql and sourcing the database. After exiting mysql, the user can seed the database from the command line and then run the application to connect to the localhost server and use the API GET, POST, PUT and DELETE commands.

## Installation

You will need mysql2, sequelize, express, and dotenv listed in the package.json. You will also need to download node.js and mysql. To run the api routes, use Insomnia Core.
